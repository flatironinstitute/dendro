# Import files from DANDI

To import files to this project, use the checkboxes to select the files and then click "Import selected assets". The import may take some time depending on the number of files selected. No data will actually be transferred as the Dendro files are only pointers to the resources. After the files have been imported, they will be visible in the Files tab.
